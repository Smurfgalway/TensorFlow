# Problem sheet 4: TensorFlow
The following Repository is for my college module [Emerging Technologies](https://emerging-technologies.github.io/). It is for the 4th and final [problem sheet](https://emerging-technologies.github.io/problems/tensorflow.html) in this module. The problem sheet focuses on using:

[Tensorflow](https://www.tensorflow.org/) is an open source library for numerial computatin using data flow graphs. Nodes in the graph represent mathematical operations, while the graph edges represent the multidimensional data arrays (tensors) communicated between them.

Tensorflow is compiled and ran inside the [Jupter Notebook](http://jupyter.org/). TThe Jupyter Notebook is an open-source web application that allows you to create and share documents that contain live code, equations, visualizations and narrative text. Uses include: data cleaning and transformation, numerical simulation, statistical modeling, data visualization, machine learning, and much more.

In this problem sheet I will be using [Keras](https://keras.io/). Keras is a high-level neural networks API, written in Python and capable of running on top of TensorFlow, CNTK, or Theano. It was developed with a focus on enabling fast experimentation. Being able to go from idea to result with the least possible delay is key to doing good research.

In this particular Problem sheet Jupyter and Tensorflow are reading from the [Iris Data set](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iris_flower_data_set) 
below is a Scatterplot of the data set and a small screenshot of the data contained in the dataset. A full view of the data can be gotten by clicking the iris.csv in this Repository
